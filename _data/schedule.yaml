In this session, youâ€™ll learn about three ways to make your app a little â€˜smarterâ€™:  able to perceive its physical surroundings and able to leverage its data more efficiently. Weâ€™ll take the QuickNoms recipe app and enhance it with a sensor integration and two methods of adding Machine Learning to take a simple recipe app and turn it into something much more interesting."

But, just because you can share code across multiple platforms, doesnâ€™t mean that you necessarily should.
        
        In this talk weâ€™ll first take a look at what NativeScript makes possible from a code sharing perspective. Weâ€™ll build a few Angular components and use them both in the browser and on mobile devices. Then weâ€™ll take a step back and look at the same code from a pragmatic, maintenance-oriented perspective. Come for practical tips & tricks on sharing code across multiple development environments."
